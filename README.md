# Visualixir

Visualixir is a toy visualizer for BEAM nodes, written in Elixir + Phoenix + d3, with live message sequence charts.

It's largely intended as a teaching tool, to give newer BEAM programmers a look into the process ecosystem living inside their nodes. However, it may prove of some amusement/use to more experienced folks (it's kinda neat to trace `iex` and the io system).

## Getting Going
asdf install

$ sudo rm -rf $(xcode-select -print-path)

$ xcode-select --install

npm i node-sass --sass_binary_site=https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/node-sass/

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile: `mix deps.get && mix compile && cd assets && npm install --unsafe-perm && cd -`
3. Start 'er up: `elixir --sname visualixir -S mix phx.server`. iex --name visualixir@127.0.0.1 -S mix phx.server
4. Navigate to [the GUI](http://0.0.0.0:4000)

If you want to visualize other BEAM nodes, you'll need to start them up with the `--sname <unique_name_here>` option.

I suggest you use Chrome for Visualixir, Safari and Firefox's SVG performance seems to be lacking. :(

There are a couple example modules included, [SingleNodePingPong](https://github.com/koudelka/visualixir/blob/master/lib/visualixir/examples/single_node_ping_pong.ex) and [MultiNodePingPong](https://github.com/koudelka/visualixir/blob/master/lib/visualixir/examples/multi_node_ping_pong.ex). Additionally, there's a [Cluster](https://github.com/koudelka/visualixir/blob/master/test/support/cluster.ex) module to start up additional `:slave` nodes.

## Usage

#### Selecting Nodes
On the upper left of the terrible GUI is a list of nodes that Visualixir curently knows about, including itself. You can click on a node's name to visualize it, or you can add a new node by entering it in the text box.

#### Moving Around
Drag the background to pan around.

Move processes around and pin them down by dragging and dropping. To un-pin, double click.

Zoom by scrolling (mousewheel or two-finger swipe).

#### Message Tracing
Option-dragging (alt-dragging), will open a new "conversation", you can drop a set of pids into the upper left box to start tracing, you should see messages they send/receive in the adjoining box. Its outline will change to red to remind you that you're tracing it. You can click the `Stop Msg Tracing` button to halt all message tracing.

The live message sequence charts have a configurable fade time, but there's no GUI for it yet, see [web/static/js/message_sequence.js](https://github.com/koudelka/visualixir/blob/master/web/static/js/message_sequence.js)

The charting library is [here](https://github.com/koudelka/d3-message-sequence), and it'd love some pull requests. <3

## Warning
Do not run Visualixir on production nodes, seriously. I've tried to make it somewhat safe, but I suspect you can get into some bad message-tracing scenarios that'll compromise your node.

## Caveats
This a prototype, obviously, the code is a steaming pile of garbage. Visualixir is largely intended to be a playground for screwing around with visualization ideas. I'd love to see what folks come up with, PR's are gladly accepted! ðŸ’• (the GUI needs a lot of help)
